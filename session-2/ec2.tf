# ###### block && argument


# # Terraform has two main blocks (resource vs data resource)
# # Resource Block = create and manage
# # Resource Block has two lables = first_label, second_label
# # FIRST_LABEL = indicates the resource that you want to create or manage, defined by HashiCorp
# # SECOND_LABEL  = indicates the logical name or logical ID for your Terraform resource, unique within your working directory, defined by the Author
# ##### Argument = configuration of your resource, key = value
